## Rules of the game

The players will throw the dice, and die 1 will determine the category:

    1 = General Knowledge
    2 = Art
    3 = History
    4 = Geography
    5 = Sports
    6 = Math

The second die will determine the points that the player will gain if answers correctly.

After each question, the turn will be passed to the next player.

The game will continue until one of the players get the score stated by the programmer in the [Setting the winning score section](#setting-the-winning-score).

### Setting the winning score

The winning_score variable at the beginning of the main function will set the number of points that a player should get to be declared as the winner.

The programmer can change this value according to his/her needs.

**NOTE:** when changing the winning_score variable, remember to update the [welcome.txt](./welcome.txt) file.

### Adding new questions

All new questions are stored in the Google Sheets file, but the file can grow as much as needed/wanted. The code is already adapted to have as many questions per category as the programmer wants.

<!-- trunk-ignore(markdownlint/MD046) -->
```Python
category_sheet = SHEET.worksheet(category)
nbr_of_rows = len(category_sheet.get_all_values())
question = category_sheet.row_values(random.randint(2,nbr_of_rows - 1))
```
