# Mr. Know-it-all Game

## Introduction

Mr. Know-it-all is a trivia game developed in Python in which the player(s) (up to 4) will answer questions on different topics until one of them reaches a specific score (set by the programmer).

## Rules of the game

The players will throw the dice, and die 1 will determine the category:

    1 = General Knowledge
    2 = Art
    3 = History
    4 = Geography
    5 = Sports
    6 = Math

The second die will determine the points that the player will gain if answers correctly.

After each question, the turn will be passed to the next player.

The game will continue until one of the players get the score stated by the programmer in the [Setting the winning score section](#setting-the-winning-score).

## Design

The design of the game was based on CLI, therefore, one of the goals was to be as clear as possible, so the user would be always aware of how the interaction should take place, namely, what keys or characters should be inserted to play the game and navigate through its segments.

## User experience (UX)

### User Stories

- As a player, I want to:
  - Have clear indications on how to play.
  - Have an easy-to-understand UI.
  - Have the expected inputs from my side which are also non-case sensitive.
  - Display a leaders board, so I can know what the top 5 scores are.

- As a Game Administrator (programmer), I want to:
  - Be able to easily modify the question and their quantity.
  - Be able to easily modify the **winning score**.

### Strategy

All stories are based on accessibility, either for the user and the way to interact with the game, or for the programmer and the easiness in modifying the game settings.

#### User

All game stages have explicit instructions, and each time an input is required, the game will clearly state what are the options and will react to them, as shown below:

![Rules and UX example](./assets/images/rules_ux.png)

#### Administrator

The administrator will have the chance to modify the following parameters and features:

##### Welcome message

The welcome message is stored in the [welcome.txt](./welcome.txt) file.

Any change in this file will be reflected in the welcome message in the terminal.

##### Maximum Number of Players (`max_num_players`)

- Default value = 4

   ![max_num_players](./assets/images/max_num_players.png)

   **NOTE:** The sheets file will respond accordingly.

##### Increase, decrease, or modify the questions

It can be done directly in the Google Sheets file. The code is already content agnostic, hence, no modification is needed in the `run.py` file.

The Google Sheets file can grow as much as needed/wanted. The code is already adapted to have as many questions per category as the programmer wants.

<!-- trunk-ignore(markdownlint/MD046) -->
```Python
category_sheet = SHEET.worksheet(category)
nbr_of_rows = len(category_sheet.get_all_values())
question = category_sheet.row_values(random.randint(2,nbr_of_rows - 1))
```

##### Loading animation

For this, it only would be needed to change the sequence list in the `throw_dice` function.


<!-- trunk-ignore(markdownlint/MD040) -->
<!-- trunk-ignore(markdownlint/MD046) -->
```
loading = [
        "[        ]",
        "[>       ]",
        "[>>      ]",
        "[>>>     ]",
        "[>>>>    ]",
        "[>>>>>   ]",
        "[>>>>>>  ]",
        "[>>>>>>> ]",
        "[>>>>>>>>]",
        "[ >>>>>>>]",
        "[  >>>>>>]",
        "[   >>>>>]",
        "[    >>>>]",
        "[     >>>]",
        "[      >>]",
        "[       >]",
        "[        ]",
        "[       <]",
        "[      <<]",
        "[     <<<]",
        "[    <<<<]",
        "[   <<<<<]",
        "[  <<<<<<]",
        "[ <<<<<<<]",
        "[<<<<<<<<]",
        "[<<<<<<< ]",
        "[<<<<<<  ]",
        "[<<<<<   ]",
        "[<<<<    ]",
        "[<<<     ]",
        "[<<      ]",
        "[<       ]"
        ]
```

##### Winning Score

The winning_score variable at the beginning of the main function will set the number of points that a player should get to be declared as the winner.

The programmer can change this value according to his/her needs.

**NOTE:** when changing the winning_score variable, remember to update the [welcome.txt](./welcome.txt) file.
