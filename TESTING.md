## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

`Welcome message, instructions, and leader board`

| Goals | How are they achieved? | Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| As a player, I want to have clear indications on how to play. | The game starts with a welcome message that includes the description, objective of the game, and rules.<br />Over the course of the game, the user will be prompted for inputs with clear expected characters.| ![Welcome message](./assets/images/mkia_welcome.png)<br />![Expected Inputs](./assets/images/inputs.png)|
| As a player, I want to have the expected inputs from my side which are also non-case sensitive. | All inputs are non-case sensitive| ![Case sensitive](./assets/images/case_sensitive.png) |
|As a player, I want have a leaders board, so I can know what the top 5 scores are. | At the end of each game a leader board is displayed and it is updated with each game played | ![Leader Board](./assets/images/leader_board.png)|

`Admin User`

| Goals | How are they achieved? | Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Be able to easily modify the question and their quantity. | As the program uses the number of rows counted directly from the Google Sheets file, there is no need to modify anyhting in the `run.py` file | :--- |
| As an admin user, I want to be able to easily modify the winning score. | The admin should only need to change the value of the `winning_score` variable in the `main()` function. | ![Winning Score](./assets/images/winning_score.png) |
